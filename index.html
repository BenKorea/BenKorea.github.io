The choice of most appropriate RAI activities to administer with the aim to reach an efficient remnant ablation and reduce the risk of recurrence is yet an open issue and the detection of basal factors that may predict treatment response seems fundamental. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) in predicting 1-year and 5-year treatment response after RAIT and prognosis.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Postmenopause is associated with recurrence of differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma;,citation_abstract=Differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma (D-PTC) is the most common malignancy arising in the thyroid gland. There are gender differences in the incidence of PTC being mainly observed in females. Low-risk groups consisted of men younger than 40-year-old and women younger than 50-year-old, whereas the high-risk group are older patients. We believe that age is not enough to explain the clinical course of this neoplasm and hypothesize that aggressive behavior of D-PTC may be correlated with hormonal status. Studies that support this idea showed that the follicular neoplastic cells had higher estrogen receptor-alpha in premenopausal (28.1+/-4.5) than in postmenopausal women (14.2+/-2.9). According to author’s prior observations, there are evidences correlating recurrence of D-PTC with postmenopause in women. Postmenopause status is characterized by estrogen decrease and FSH increases both associated with EGFR activation. Previous observations identified EGFR over-expression in D-PTC of postmenopause when compared with premenopausal ladies. CONCLUSIONS: Postmenopause is an adverse factor for tumor evolution in women with D-PTC and is associated with EGFR expression. It’s introduction in thyroid tumor stratification could be a fine tuning in predicting papillary thyroid carcinoma behavior.;,citation_author=F. A. Candanedo-Gonzalez;,citation_author=A.

METHODS: The records of 653 patients with PTC were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors associated with LLNM in 460 patients (&amp;amp;amp;quot;derivation group&amp;quot;). Two models [including and excluding the subregions of central lymph node metastasis (CLNM)] were used to predict the probability of level-II LLNM; the same two models were also used for level-III/IV LLNM.

Two web-based nomograms were established. RESULTS: Increased tumor size, a tumor in the upper lobe, and prelaryngeal and ipsilateral paratracheal lymph node metastasis (LNM) were significantly associated with level-II LNM (P&amp;lt;0.05). Increased tumor size, a tumor in the upper lobe, and certain subregions of CLNM were associated with level-III/IV LNM (P&amp;lt;0.05). Use of ROC analysis of each model indicated that including subgroups of CLNM led to better model performance than excluding these subgroups.

We aimed to investigate the impact of focality, TTD, number of tumour foci, or laterality on aggressive features in PTC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients were categorized based on maximum tumour diameter (MTD) (≤ 10 vs. &amp;amp;amp;gt; 10 mm), focality, laterality, or the number of tumour foci (1/2/ ≥ 3). We also categorized the patients as follows: Group 1, unifocal microcarcinoma (MTD ≤ 10/TTD ≤ 10 mm); Group 2, multifocal microcarcinoma (MTD ≤ 10/TTD ≤ 10 mm); Group 3, multifocal microcarcinoma (MTD ≤ 10/TTD &amp;gt; 10 mm); Group 4, unifocal macrocarcinoma (MTD > 10/TTD > 10 mm); Group 5, multifocal macrocarcinoma (MTD > 10/TTD > 10 mm).

An increasing number of tumour foci were associated with a higher MTD or TTD, a higher ratio of extrathyroidal extension (ETE), vascular or lymphatic invasion, lymph node metastasis (LNM) or distant metastasis, or the need for radioactive iodine (RAI). There was no difference in the parameters between Group 3 and Group 2, or Group 4. Vascular invasion, American Thyroid Association high risk, LNM at diagnosis, and RAI total dose were higher in Group 5 than in Group 3.

The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of the nomograms were evaluated by the concordance index (C-index) and calibration curve. In addition, a validation cohort was included at the same institution.Multivariate analysis demonstrated that family history, maximal tumor diameter, capsular invasion, and lymph node staging were independent risk factors for regional recurrence-free survival; and family history, histological variants, capsular invasion, perineuronal invasion, and vascular invasion were independent risk factors for distant recurrence-free survival. They were selected into the 2 nomograms, respectively, and the C-index for regional recurrence-free survival and distant recurrence-free survival prediction were 0.72 and 0.83, respectively. In the validation cohort, the 2 nomograms displayed a C-index of 0.72 and 0.89, respectively.The nomograms developed in this study demonstrated their discrimination capability for predicting 3 and 5-year regional recurrence and distant recurrence after partial or total thyroidectomy, and can be used to identify high-risk patients.;,citation_author=M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Dynamic Risk Stratification for Predicting Treatment Response in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer;,citation_abstract=Prognosis in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC) patients is excellent, but a significant degree of overtreatment still exists because of the inability to accurately identify small patient cohorts who experience a more aggressive form of the disease, often associated with certain poor prognostic factors. Identifying these cohorts at an early stage would allow patients at high risk to receive more aggressive treatment while avoiding unnecessary and invasive treatments in those at low risk. Most risk stratification systems include age, tumor size, grade, presence of local invasion, and regional or distant metastases. Here we discuss these common factors as well as their association with treatment response, but also other upcoming markers including histology and multifocality of primary tumor, dose administered and preparation method for Radioiodine Therapy (RAI), Thyroglobulin (Tg), Anti-thyroglobulin Antibodies (Tg-Ab) levels both at initial management and during follow-up, and the presence of previously existing benign thyroid disease. In addition, we examine the role of remnant size and avidity as well as surgeons’ experience in performing thyroidectomies with recurrence rate, discussing its impact on disease prognosis. Our results reveal that treatment response has a statistically significant association with histology, T and M stages, surgeons’ experience, Tg levels and remnant score both during RAI and follow up and Tg-Ab levels during follow-up whole body scan (WBS).;,citation_author=E.

The 2015 ATA version, which has increased the number of patients considered at low or intermediate risk, has been validated in several retrospective, single-center studies. The aims of this study were to evaluate the real-world performance of the 2015 ATA risk stratification system in predicting the response to treatment 12 months after the initial treatment and to determine the extent to which this performance is affected by the treatment center in which it is used. Methods: A prospective cohort of DTC patients collected by the Italian Thyroid Cancer Observatory web-based database was analyzed. We reviewed all records present in the database and selected consecutive cases that satisfied inclusion criteria: (i) histological diagnosis of DTC, with the exclusion of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features; (ii) complete data of the initial treatment and pathological features; and (iii) results of 1-year follow-up visit (6-18 months after the initial treatment), including all data needed to classify the estimated response to treatment.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=2015 American Thyroid Association Management Guidelines for Adult Patients with Thyroid Nodules and Differentiated Thyroid Cancer;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem, and differentiated thyroid cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent. Since the American Thyroid Association’s guidelines for the management of these disorders were revised in 2009, significant scientific advances have occurred in the field. The aim of this these guidelines is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on published evidence relating to the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer. METHODS: The specific clinical questions addressed in this these guidelines were based on prior versions of the guidelines, stakeholder input, and input of task force members. Task force panel members were educated on knowledge synthesis methods, including: electronic database searching, review and selection of relevant citations, and critical appraisal of selected studies. Published English language articles on adults were eligible for inclusion. The American College of Physicians (ACP) Guideline Grading System was used for critical appraisal of evidence and grading strength of recommendations for therapeutic interventions. We developed a similarly formatted system to appraise the quality of such studies and resultant recommendations. The guideline panel had complete editorial independence from the ATA. Competing interests of guideline task force members were regularly updated, managed and communicated to the ATA and task force members. RESULTS: The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules include recommendations regarding initial evaluation, clinical and ultrasound criteria for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, interpretation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy results, use of molecular markers and management of benign thyroid nodules. Recommendations regarding the initial management of thyroid cancer include those relating to screening for thyroid cancer, staging and risk assessment, surgical management, radioiodine remnant ablation and therapy, and TSH suppression therapy using levothyroxine. Recommendations related to long-term management of differentiated thyroid cancer include those related to surveillance for recurrent disease using imaging and serum thyroglobulin, thyroid hormone therapy, management of recurrent and metastatic disease, consideration for clinical trials and targeted therapy, as well as directions for future research. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed evidence-based recommendations to inform clinical decision- making in the management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prognostic Implications of Lymph Node Yield in Central and Lateral Neck Dissections for Well-Differentiated Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma;,citation_abstract=PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between lymph node yield (LNY) from central (CND) and lateral (LND) neck dissections and risk of recurrence in patients undergoing primary surgery for well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma (WDPTC). METHODS: Clinical data were reviewed from all patients with biopsy-proven WDPTC who underwent primary total thyroidectomy with CND or LND at the authors’ institution from 2005 to 2009. Patient demographics and tumor characteristics were obtained, and clinical data with at least five-year follow-up were used. Within the CNDs and LNDs, total number of nodes removed (LNY), total positive nodes removed, and the ratio of positive lymph nodes to LNY were determined. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-two patients were included in the study, with average follow-up of 69 months. Of 125 patients who underwent CND, 20 had central neck disease recurrence. The LNY of patients with central neck recurrence was significantly less than those who had no recurrence (2.5 vs. 10.3; p &amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). Of 71 patients who underwent LND, 23 had ipsilateral lateral neck disease recurrence. The LNY of patients with lateral neck recurrence was significantly less than those who did not recur (10.5 vs. 24.6; p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Higher rates of recurrence were associated with smaller LNY in both groups. For both groups, lower LNY remains predictive of recurrence on multivariate analysis controlling for pT stage, pN stage, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, and radioactive iodine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Higher LNY in CNDs and LNDs is associated with lower rates of papillary thyroid carcinoma recurrence in the central and lateral neck. To minimize the risk of recurrence and the need for secondary therapy with revision surgery and/or radiation, surgeons should perform thorough, compartment-oriented CNDs and LNDs when nodal surgery is undertaken.;,citation_author=C.

We evaluated the association between multifocality and bilaterality of PTC and disease recurrence/persistence. We also analyzed the location and number of tumors in multifocal PTC. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 2,095 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy for PTC. Tumors were classified as solitary or multifocal PTC according to the number of tumors present. Multifocal PTCs were subdivided into multifocal-unilateral and multifocal-bilateral PTC based on the tumor location. Solitary tumor or multifocal tumors located in one lobe were classified as unilateral PTC, and tumors in both lobes were classified as bilateral PTC. We analyzed the clinicopathologic features and clinical outcomes in each classification. Logistic regression models were used to assess the relation between multifocality or bilaterality and disease recurrence/persistence. RESULTS: Extrathyroidal invasion, cervical lymph node metastasis, and advanced TNM stage were significantly more frequent in multifocal PTC than in solitary PTC.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prognostic significance of tumor multifocality in papillary thyroid carcinoma and its relationship with primary tumor size: a retrospective study of 2,309 consecutive patients;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Tumor multifocality is frequently observed in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), but its prognostic value is controversial. We investigated the prognostic significance of multifocality in PTCs larger than 1 cm and papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (PTMC). METHODS: Medical records and pathologic results of 2,309 patients who received thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection for PTC were retrospectively reviewed. We identified 648 patients who had PTC with a primary tumor exceeding 1 cm, and 1,661 patients with PTMC. In each group, we compared patients with unifocal and multifocal disease. Cox regression analyses of disease persistence and recurrence were performed to identify the prognostic significance of multifocality. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 5.6 years. In the analyses of PTCs larger than 1 cm, the multifocal group included more extensive thyroid surgeries (p = 0.039), radioactive iodine therapies with higher doses (p &amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and significantly higher rates of disease persistence and recurrence (p = 0.001) compared with the unifocal group. In analogous analyses of patients with PTMC, disease persistence and recurrence did not differ significantly between the unifocal and multifocal groups. Cox regression analyses indicated that multifocality was an independent risk factor for disease persistence and recurrence in patients who had PTC with a tumor exceeding 1 cm, but not in patients with PTMC. CONCLUSION: Tumor multifocality appears to be an important prognostic factor for PTCs larger than 1 cm, but may have little or no prognostic significance for PTMC.;,citation_author=K. J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Combination of initial stimulation thyroglobulins and staging system by revised ATA guidelines can elaborately discriminate prognosis of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma after high-dose remnant ablation;,citation_abstract=PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate prognostic role of thyroglobulin (Tg) levels at the time of ablation (A-Tg) and stimulation Tg levels at 6-12 months after remnant ablation (S-Tg) combined with revised American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines risk stratification. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data of 359 patients (median follow-up duration: 66.3 months) with papillary thyroid carcinoma who had high-dose remnant ablation were analyzed. The cutoff value of A-Tg to predict the persistent/recurrent disease was calculated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. In each risk group by ATA guidelines, the association of A-Tg with persistent/recurrent disease was evaluated. The role of A-Tg and ATA risk stratification in each S-Tg group (group with S-Tg &amp;amp;amp;lt;2 ng/mL, 2-10 ng/mL, or &amp;gt;10 ng/mL) was also evaluated. Tg response was determined by the difference between A-Tg and S-Tg with consideration of the dose of radioactive iodine ablation. RESULTS: A-Tg above 5.22 ng/mL was associated with persistent/recurrent disease in all risk groups by ATA guidelines. A-Tg above the cutoff value and ATA risk assessment was related to persistent/recurrent disease in patients with S-Tg 2 to 10 ng/mL (P = 0.003) and S-Tg above 10 ng/mL (P = 0.019). However, no difference in the incidence of persistent/recurrent disease was found according to Tg response. The scoring system made up of A-Tg, S-Tg, and ATA staging showed elaborate discrimination of prognosis. CONCLUSION: Risk stratification using combined scoring with initial stimulated Tg levels, including A-Tg and S-Tg, and staging system by revised ATA guidelines can effectively predict persistent/recurrent disease in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma.;,citation_author=M.

The clinical significance of the longitudinal changes in NLR following treatment remained unestablished. Methods: Adults patients with differentiated thyroid cancer were included in the study if the follow-up NLR data at 6 to 18 months after initial treatment were available. The response to treatment was categorized as excellent, indeterminate, biochemical incomplete, and structural incomplete as per guidelines of the American Thyroid Association. Results: Among 151 patients with thyroid cancer, a significant decrease in NLR following treatment was observed in those with stage I disease, those with low risk of recurrence, and those with an excellent response to therapy. Patients with a structural incomplete response had a significant increase in NLR at follow-up (p = 0.012). On multivariate analysis, incomplete response to therapy was associated with male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 3.35), tumor size (OR = 1.63), lymph node metastasis (OR = 4.80), distant metastasis (OR = 12.95), and increased NLR (OR = 13.68).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Lymph node ratio as a tool to stratify patients with N1b papillary thyroid cancer;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: The prognostic significance of lymph node ratio (LNR) in N1b papillary thyroid cancer is unclear. Therefore, the impact of LNR on disease-specific mortality (DSM) and overall survival (OS) in patients with N1b papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) needs to be defined. METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database of patients who had undergone thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection. Factors associated with DSM and OS were analyzed and identified using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional risk models. X-tile software was used to find the best cutoff value of LNR. Kaplan-Meier estimates for DSM were plotted for LNR and were compared with the log-rank test. The ROC curve evaluated the validity of the model. RESULTS: A total of 3223 patients with N1b PTC were identified in the SEER database between 1975 and 2019. The best cutoff value for LNR was 0.6. The multivariate Cox proportional risk model showed that age, race, T3/T4 classification, distant metastasis, extent of surgery, number of metastatic lymph nodes, and LNR &amp;amp;amp;gt; 0.6 were independent risk factors for DSM (all p &amp;lt; 0.05). Age, sex, T4 classification, distant metastasis, extent of surgery, and LNR &amp;gt; 0.6 were independent risk factors for OS (all p &amp;lt; 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier method plotted a cumulative risk curve and showed that patients with LNR > 0.6 had a significantly higher risk of DSM than patients with LNR ≤ 0.6 (p = 0.002).

In a previous study, we observed an association between metabolic setting, circulating adipocytokines and thyroid cancer phenotype. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical follow-up of patients with DTC and the predictive role of metabolic setting on the risk of tumour relapse. METHODS: Between September 2016 and January 2017, 57 patients were admitted to our institution to undergo total thyroidectomy because of suspected DTC. Thirty patients with post-surgical histological diagnosis of DTC were included in the study. Each subject underwent pre-surgical analysis of anthropometric parameters, thyroid function and autoimmunity, glucose metabolism, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and levels of unacylated and acylated ghrelin, obestatin, leptin and adiponectin. Tumour recurrence at 1 and 3 years from diagnosis was assessed. RESULTS: Most patients were females (21F, 9M) with a median age at diagnosis of 50.0 (41.0-58.8).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Factors predicting the risk of biochemical incomplete response in well-differentiated thyroid cancer after total thyroidectomy;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is the most common endocrine carcinoma with an overall good prognosis. However, persistent or recurrent disease (P/R disease) and incomplete biochemical response (BIR) are causes of morbidity. Histopathology and TNM stage may not predict P/R disease and BIR in all patients. Various clinical parameters, histopathological features and preablative-stimulated thyroglobulin (presTg) have been proposed to predicts P/R disease. However, there is uncertainty for presTg cutoff and diagnostic accuracy. The study’s objective was to predict the BIR before radioiodine ablation from available clinical, histopathological and biochemical parameters. METHODS: A retrospective, single-center study, including DTC patients, was done. Demography and factors predicting BIR evaluated. RESULT: In comparison to the patients in remission, patients with BIR were older (P = 0.042), had higher presTg (P &amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and lymph nodes (LN) metastases [central or lateral compartment (P &amp;lt; 0.001)]. Visualization of LN on whole-body scan (P = 0.014), higher TNM stage (P = 0.001) and distance metastasis (P < 0.001) were also associated with BIR. On multivariate analysis, high presTg (P < 0.001) and LN metastases (LNscan and histopathologically proven LN involvement, P < 0.001) were associated with BIR.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Influence of age and primary tumor size on the risk for residual/recurrent well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Though age and primary tumor size predict cancer-specific survival in well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (WDTC), their influence on residual/recurrent disease has not been elucidated. METHODS: In a retrospective study, residual/recurrent disease was defined by the surrogate outcome of positive (&amp;amp;amp;gt;or=2 microg/L) follow-up stimulated thyroglobulin after surgery and radioactive remnant ablation. Age, primary tumor size, and clinical staging systems were examined in the context of stimulated thyroglobulin outcome. RESULTS: A total of 246 patients were followed up for a mean of 5.8 years. No significant difference in age (t(239) = 0.61, p &amp;gt; .05) or tumor size (t(237) = 0.16, p > .05) was found among patients with positive follow-up stimulated thyroglobulin compared with those with negative results. pTNM staging failed to demonstrate significant, stage-dependent increase in the percentage of patients with positive stimulated thyroglobulin, chi(2)(2, N = 229) = 0.17, p > .05, unlike staging based solely on surgical pathology, chi(2)(2, N = 241) = 34.97, p &amp;lt; .001.

PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the impact of the last two editions of TNM and ATA RSS in the prediction of persistent/recurrent disease in a large series of DTC patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our prospective study included 451 patients undergone thyroidectomy for DTC. We classified the patients according to TNM (both VIII and VII ed.) and stratified them according to the ATA RSS (both 2015 and 2009). We then evaluated the response to the initial therapy after 12-18 months according to the ATA &amp;amp;amp;quot;ongoing&amp;quot; risk stratification, and analyzed the variables associated with persistent/recurrent disease by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The performance of the last two ATA RSSs was not significantly different. By staging patients according to the VIII or VII TNM editions, we found significant differences only in the distribution of patients with structural disease classified in stages III and IV. At multivariate analysis, only T-status and N-status were independently associated with persistent/recurrent disease. Overall, ATA RSSs and TNMs showed low predictive power in terms of persistent/recurrent disease (by Harrell’s test). CONCLUSIONS: In our series of DTC patients, the new ATA RSS as well as the VIII TNM staging provided no additional benefit compared to the previous editions.

We identified 51,061 DTC patients between 2004 and 2012. Patients were separated into 10-year age groups. Cancer cause-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) data were obtained. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox models were built to analyze the outcomes and risk factors. Increasing age gradient with a 10-year interval was associated with the trend of higher proportions for male gender, grade III/IV and summary stage of distant metastases. Both CSS and OS continued to worsen with increasing age, being poorest in in the oldest age group (≥71); multivariate analysis confirmed that CSS continued to fall with each age decade, significantly starting at 60 years (HR = 7.5, 95;,citation_author=R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Patient Age Is an Independent Risk Factor of Relapse of Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma and Improves the Performance of the American Thyroid Association Stratification System;,citation_abstract=Background: The 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines proposed a three-category system for estimating the risk of recurrence of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). This system includes several perioperative features, but not age at diagnosis. However, age has traditionally been recognized as a critical factor in the survival of DTC patients, and the eighth edition of TNM stated that patients older than 55 years were at higher risk of death. In this study, we raised the question of whether age at DTC diagnosis impacts on its risk of recurrence. Specifically, the present study aimed to (i) evaluate the association between age at diagnosis and structural recurrence and (ii) investigate whether age at diagnosis could improve the performance of the ATA system. Methods: During the study period, four institutions selected DTC patients treated with both thyroidectomy and radioiodine and who had follow-up for at least one year. Patients with proven structural evidence of disease during follow-up were identified, and disease-free survival (DFS) was calculated accordingly.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Use of Post-ablation Stimulated Thyroglobulin in Predicting Clinical Outcomes in Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma - What Cut-off Values Should We Use?;,citation_abstract=AIMS: Recently published international guidelines recommended using the stimulated thyroglobulin (sTg) post-radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation, in conjunction with tumour stage, as a risk stratification factor. The choice of cut-off values for sTg, namely 1 and 10 ng/ml, was, however, largely based on the functional sensitivities of the assays used, with relatively few published data addressing the prognostic impact of alternative cut-off values. Our study aims to provide data on the prognostic value of sTg at different levels of sensitivities and specificities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all adult cases of differentiated thyroid carcinoma receiving RAI ablation at our centre from 2008 to 2010. All patients had sTg measured at around 6 months post-ablation. The functional sensitivity of our assay was 0.5 ng/ml. The outcome was adverse clinical event, defined as cancer-related death, persistent macroscopic disease demonstrable on imaging (including radioisotope scan) and/or receiving further treatment for persistent or recurrent disease. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was carried out. RESULTS: We identified 140 patients treated in the review period, with 106 of them suitable for further analysis.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Can Age at Diagnosis and Sex Improve the Performance of the American Thyroid Association Risk Stratification System for Prediction of Structural Persistent and Recurrent Disease in Patients With Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma? A Multicenter Study;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: Although the age at diagnosis has been suggested as a major determinant of disease-specific survival in the recent TNM staging system, it is not included in the recent American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines to estimate the risk of recurrence. Nevertheless, the effect of sex on differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) recurrence is controversial. Therefore, this multicenter study was conducted to assess whether age at diagnosis and sex can improve the performance of the ATA 3-tiered risk stratification system in patients with DTC with at least 5 years of follow-up. METHODS: In this study, the computer-recorded data of the patients diagnosed with DTC between January 1985 and January 2016 were analyzed. Only patients with proven structural persistent/recurrent disease were selected for comparisons. RESULTS: This study consisted of 1691 patients (female, 1367) with DTC. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, disease-free survival (DFS) was markedly longer in females only in the ATA low-risk category (P&nbsp;= .045). Nevertheless, a markedly longer DFS was observed in patients aged &amp;amp;amp;lt;45 years in the ATA low- and intermediate-risk categories (P&nbsp;= .004 and P&nbsp;= .009, respectively), whereas in patients aged &amp;lt;55 years, DFS was markedly longer only in the ATA low-risk category (P < .001). In the Cox proportional hazards model, ages of ≥45 and ≥55 years at diagnosis and the ATA risk stratification system were all independent predictors of persistent/recurrent disease. CONCLUSION: Applying the age cutoff of 45 years in the ATA intermediate- and low-risk categories may identify patients at a higher risk of persistence/recurrence and may improve the performance of the ATA risk stratification system, whereas sex may improve the performance of only the ATA low-risk category.;,citation_author=S.

This retrospective research was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Medical data of patients diagnosed and treated for PTC at KIRAMS from 2003 to 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. We included patients who were diagnosed with PTC and underwent total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection with/without lateral neck dissection. We excluded (1) cases with a distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis, (2) patients who received previous surgery or radiotherapy to the head and neck area, and (3) cases with insufficient clinical data that were lost to follow-up after surgery. Finally, ? patients were included in the study, including ? males and ? females. Their ages ranged from 13 to 79&nbsp;years and the mean age was ?&nbsp;years. Tumor stage was classified according to the 8th AJCC staging system.</p>
<p>To detect disease recurrence, all patients underwent physical examination, ultrasound, and thyroglobulin measurement every 6–24&nbsp;months after surgery. If necessary, additional imaging studies such as computed tomography, whole body iodine scan, and positron emission tomography were performed. Recurrence was defined as a case in which a new lesion was detected that was not previously observed in the imaging studies and which was pathologically confirmed through fine needle aspiration cytology.</p>
<p>Tumor size, ETE, multiplicity, ENE, and TNM stage were analyzed. The surgical specimens from central neck dissection were divided into ipsilateral and contralateral areas according to the location of the tumor, and therein the number of metastatic LNs and the total number of harvested LNs were recorded. LNR was calculated by dividing the number of metastatic LNs by the total number of harvested LNs. The cut-off value of LNR was determined in consideration of optimized sensitivity and specificity for predicting disease recurrence using receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC). The optimal value of LNR was used to construct machine learning models for predicting disease recurrences.</p>
<p>Machine learning was performed based on the supervised learning method, and a variety of machine learning models was used including the decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, and Stacking models. Learning was performed with the five models mentioned above, and accuracy was used to evaluate model performance. Scikit-learn version 12.3 was used for model building and learning. 80% of the data set was classified as the training set and was used for learning, and the remaining 20% was used as a test set. To account for selection bias, the five-fold-cross-validation technique was applied.</p>
<p>Patient clinical information, pathologic information, recurrence, and cause of recurrence were analyzed. The Chi-square or independent two-sample t-test were used to evaluate differences in variables between two independent groups. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the effect of several variables on disease recurrence. <em>p</em> values &lt; 0.05 were considered indicative of statistical significance. Statistical analyses were performed using python 3.8 version and SPSS version 25.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL).</p>
